== Preface by Author 1

You can write a preface here. This preface was written by Simon Mudd, who also prepared this template for your book and website writing pleasure. People like to read the preface when they are feeling tired and don't want to think about the technical stuff in the book. It is a good place to put some personal anecdotes, for example my favourite football team is [Hibernian FC], which is also the favourite football team of [The Proclaimers], [Irvine Welsh], and [Andy Murray]. Also I wrote this section on the number 41 Lothian Bus.
